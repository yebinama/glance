upgrade:
  - |
    Add ability to import image into multiple stores during `interoperable
    image import process`_.
    This feature will only work if multiple stores are enabled in the
    deployment.
    It introduces 3 new optional body fields to the `import API path`:

    - ``stores``: List containing the stores id to import the image binary data
      to.

    - ``all_stores``: To import the data in all configured stores.

    - ``all_stores_must_succeed``: Control wether the import have to succeed in
      all stores.

    Users can follow workflow execution with 2 new reserved properties:

    - ``os_glance_importing_to_stores``: list of stores that has not yet been
      processed.

    - ``os_glance_failed_import``: Each time an import in a store fails, it is
      added to this list.
