upgrade:
  - |
    Add ability to import image into multiple stores during `interoperable
    image import process`_.
    This feature will only work if multiple stores are enabled in the
    deployment.
    It introduces 3 new optional body fields (``stores``, ``all_stores``,
    ``all_stores_must_succeed``) to the `import API path`.
    Users can follow workflow execution with 2 new reserved properties
    ``os_glance_importing_to_stores`` and ``os_glance_failed_import``.
